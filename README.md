### 🔭 My free software (自作プログラム)
#### Soil physics (土壌物理学)
- [SWRC Fit](https://seki.webmasters.gr.jp/swrc/) is a web interface for fitting soil water retention curve used in [many researches](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Gs_ABawAAAAJ&citation_for_view=Gs_ABawAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC).
- [Unsatfit](https://sekika.github.io/unsatfit/) - Python library for optimizing parameters of functions of soil hydraulic properties. SWRC Fit uses unsatfit, and unsatfit also fits unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.
- [EC fit](https://seki.webmasters.gr.jp/ecfit/) - fit soil water and electrical conductivity (EC) model to measured data.
- [Discfit](https://github.com/sekika/discfit) - Disc permeameter fitting program

#### Security (セキュリティ)
- [Passme](https://github.com/sekika/passme/blob/master/doc/README.rst) - a password management tool with command line or web browzer. [Tutorial movie](https://github.com/sekika/passme/blob/master/doc/README.rst#:~:text=https%3A//youtu.be/6DXPhyYhYsE).

#### Puzzle (パズル)
- [Kaidoku](https://sekika.github.io/kaidoku/)　([解独](https://sekika.github.io/kaidoku/ja/)) - solve, play and create sudoku puzzles (ナンプレ) with a command-line interface. It shows [logics](https://sekika.github.io/kaidoku/logic) for solving a puzzle. [Online player](https://sekika.github.io/kaidoku/sudoku) and [PDF books](https://sekika.github.io/kaidoku/book) are also available.
- [15 Puzzle](https://sekika.github.io/2020/01/14/15Puzzle/) ([15パズル](https://sekika.github.io/2020/01/17/15Puzzle/)) - online player of a sliding puzzle. The size of the puzzle can be changed to (3, 8, 15, 24, 35, ...) puzzles.

#### JavaScript
